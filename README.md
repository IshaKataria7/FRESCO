## FRESCO : STUDENT NEEDS MANAGEMENT WEBAPP 

## Project Overview

This project would act as a non-profit organization whose main purpose would be to lend a hand to the needful.
This project aims to plan and implement a donation system in which the students would donate items which are
no longer in use to them but can be beneficial to some others. Other functionalities like
college navigation, outlet details, e-rickshaw availability will also be provided. The main scope of this
project is to plan, design, build and implement a web application in which all the records of the students 
who donate, receive will be managed. Several other functionalities like college navigation, outlet details,
e-rickshaw availability will be provided. Various levels of access and permissions will be granted to 
a person depending upon whether the person is an administrator or a user to view or manage the application. 
Each request from user would consist of personal information and item details.                                                                                                      This system was developed for anyone who is a newbie and wants to refer a map for guidance, can
know the transport (E-Rickshaw), outlet details and who wishes to accept/donate items. It is a web
application and would just require a device (Mobile/Tablet/PC) and an internet connectivity to use this
application.                                                                                                                                                                    With the donation system, the users will be able to search for items they require. The result will be
based on the criteria the user inputs. There are several search criteria and it will be possible for the
administrator of the system to manage those options. It will provide functionality to manage the system
and the item information. Also, users could just tap in and get information about all the outlets, etransport within the institute. 
An additional map of the institute will be provided for the newbies.
